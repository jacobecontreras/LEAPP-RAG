# LEAPP RAG + Custom ReAct Agent

> **DISCLAIMER:** This tool is a proof-of-concept designed strictly for educational purposes and data location assistance. It is **not** a substitute for manual data verification or forensic conclusions. All outputs must be verified against the original evidence.

## Purpose

This project explores the mechanics of AI agents within a forensic context. Its primary utility is to assist in locating evidence within LEAPP reports.

The system utilizes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture combined with a custom ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Agent to parse and interact with report data.

## Privacy & Configuration

All data processing, vector storage, and report viewing is fully **local**.

The only external data transmission is strictly for LLM reasoning. This is handled via **Open Router** using a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model, ensuring the user retains control over the API connection.

## Features

* **AI Assistance:** A ReAct agent for querying report data.
* **Report Viewer:** An embedded viewer for browsing the default HTML reports generated by aLEAPP and iLEAPP.
* **KML Viewer:** A map interface using Leaflet.js to visualize .kml location data.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Electron (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* **Backend:** Python FastAPI
